              A “home loan” or “mortgage” is a loan advanced to you by a
              financial institution in return for security over the property you
              are using the loan to buy. Typically, a home loan will be a 25 or
              30 year term, with regular repayment amounts fortnightly or
              monthly that are designed to pay off the loan over the contracted
              term.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-2">
              The loan is secured against your property so if you are unable to
              continue paying the loan, the lender may ultimately require you to
              sell the property to settle the debt.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
              Given property prices in Australia, a home loan is realistically
              the way by which the majority of people will afford to buy a
              house.

              Types of home loan
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-2">
              There are a number of different types of home loans in Australia.
              Home loans are commonly classified either by interest rate type,
              or by purpose. We discuss both of these options below in more
              detail.

            </h2>
            <p class="mb-2">
              The most common types of home loans that people would know about
              are variable rate home loans or fixed rate home loans – but there
              are many more options than that. Check out the following options
              when considering what would best suit your home purchase:

                <strong>Variable rate home loan</strong>
                <p>
                  A variable rate loan means that the interest rate will rise
                  and fall (vary) over the period of your home loan. This may be
                  in response to movements in the official cash rate or may
                  simply be a business decision by your financial institution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main advantage of a variable rate loan is flexibility.
                  While you must meet your minimum monthly repayment, you can
                  usually pay more if you want to. There is also no break fee
                  because there is no fixed term for you to break, so you can
                  sell your property and move without the extra fees and charges
                  that would apply to a fixed rate home loan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main disadvantage of a variable rate loan is that your
                  minimum repayment amount may rise or fall at any time. If you
                  are on a tight budget, this could be a real problem for you.

                  The main disadvantage of a variable rate loan is that your
                  minimum repayment amount may rise or fall at any time. If you
                  are on a tight budget, this could be a real problem for you.

                <strong>Variable rate home loan</strong>
                <p>
                  A variable rate loan means that the interest rate will rise
                  and fall (vary) over the period of your home loan. This may be
                  in response to movements in the official cash rate or may
                  simply be a business decision by your financial institution.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The main advantage of a variable rate loan is flexibility.
                  While you must meet your minimum monthly repayment, you can
                  usually pay more if you want to. There is also no break fee
                  because there is no fixed term for you to break, so you can
                  sell your property and move without the extra fees and charges
                  that would apply to a fixed rate home loan.
